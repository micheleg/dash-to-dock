gnome-shell-extension-ubuntu-dock (0.5) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Cherry-pick dynamic and adaptive transparency feature to look and behave
    better with GNOME Shell 3.26. We only enable adaptive transparency.
    (LP: #1717509).
  * Rationalize some keyboard and key + mouse shortcuts:
    - Click is focus or showing up window previews. Same than Super + number
      (was already the default)
    - Shift + click launch a new instance. Same than Super + Shift + number
    - Middle click cycles launch a new instance as well. This is to be
      consistent when middle clicking a link in a web browser opening a new
      tab.
    - Shift + middle click minimize the last focused window from the selected
      application.
  * Cherry-pick some fixes from dash to dock branch (without taking the other
    new features):
    - Hotkeys: remove keypad hotkeys
    - Define externally accessible classes and constants with 'var'
  * Fix uninitialized value for dock disabled by default
    (LP: #1712698, #1714219)
  * updated translations

gnome-shell-extension-ubuntu-dock (0.2) artful; urgency=medium

  * Add Replaces temporarly against gnome-shell-extension-dashtodock package
    which ships the same schema on purpose. This unblock users for the week-end
    until we decide on the best strategy to keep the schema synced and not
    diverge (should we conflicts and let people prefers installing dash to dock
    from the online extensions website local to their users, not being affected
    by our overrides… or have a separate binary package, common to both, and
    thus diverge the dash to dock package from debian?)
