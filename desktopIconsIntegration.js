/**
 * Integration class
 *
 * This class must be added to other extensions in order to integrate
 * them with Desktop Icons NG. It allows an extension to notify how much margin
 * it uses in each side of each monitor.
 *
 * DON'T SEND PATCHES TO THIS FILE TO THE EXTENSION MAINTAINER. SEND THEM TO
 * DESKTOP ICONS NG MAINTAINER: https://gitlab.com/rastersoft/desktop-icons-ng
 *
 * In the *enable()* function, create a *DesktopIconsUsableAreaClass()*
 * object with
 *
 *     new DesktopIconsIntegration.DesktopIconsUsableAreaClass(object);
 *
 * Now, in the *disable()* function just call to the *destroy()* method before
 * nullifying the pointer. You must create a new object in enable() the next
 * time the extension is enabled.
 *
 * In your code, every time you change the margins, you should call first to
 * *resetMargins()* method to clear the current margins, and then call to
 * *setMargins(...)* method as many times as you need to set the margins in each
 * monitor. You don't need to call it for all the monitors, only for those where
 * you are painting something. If you don't set values for a monitor, they will
 * be considered zero.
 *
 * The margins values are relative to the monitor border.
