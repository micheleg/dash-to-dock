### Bug Reporting
If you experienced a bug please report it by opening an [isssue on github]({{ site.github_project_url }}/issues). You can also send a bug report message in the [extension website]({{ site.extension_page_url }}). Your help is very appreciated.

Please provide as many details as possible and all the steps to reproduce the bug. Include the following information:

 * Extension version
 * Gnome Shell version
 * Linux distribution and version
 * Whether you have a multi-monitor configuration
 * Your settings: include the output of the command <code>dconf dump /org/gnome/shell/extensions/dash-to-dock/</code>.

Before reporting a bug:

 * Check if the bug persists disabling all other extensions. If not, try to find the conflicting extension by enabling each extension one at a time.
 * Check if there are any relevant errors in Looking Glass (<code>ALt-F2 lg</code>, error panel).
 * Reload the shell by typing in a terminal (as normal user) <code>gnome-shell --replace</code> and look for relevant output in that terminal when the bug appears. 
 * Try to reset the extension settings to their default values with the command <code>dconf reset /org/gnome/shell/extensions/dash-to-dock/</code>
